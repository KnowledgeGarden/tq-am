        migrating to tq-am github repo

        REFACTOR
            move agenta.clj to am_agenda
                Started agenda.md
            move engine.clj to am_engine
                Started engine.md
        Rules engine 
            It seems unlikely that the chosen rules engine will be
            adequate to the task at hand. Seems more likely will have
            to adapt the simple Java rules engine to this task - MicroIE4J
        ADDED am_ie.inferrable.clj
            The interface for MicroIE4J inference engine
        ADDED am_ie.not.clj 
            NOT 
        STARTED am_ie.and_list.clj 
            This must immplement the equivalent of List<Inferrable>
        ADDED agenda sorts
            Still compiles and runs
        TODO 
            UNIT TEST agenda  May not be the correct code
    20200726
        Went from :use to :require in core.clj
            now compiles and runs
        ADDED some agenda API
            compiles and runs
    20200725
        First cut with lein
        Shell made
        Shelled in am.clj and agenda.clj
            lein run runs ok
        Started am_rules.h0 -- first heuristics class
            Will contain several rules 
            MUST figure out how to implement an inference engine with if-then rules
        Began to shell in the am_loop
            still compiles and runs
        Added clara-rules to project.clj 
            still compiles and runs
        After a lot of fiddling, got am to run am_loop
            :use instead of :require to solve a bug would not compile with 3 requires
            but that means that am-clj.am had to be explicitly declared below
