# Heuristics

Heuristics are rules which guide all aspects of discovery, theory formation, and more.

They are not IF-THEN rules in the usual sense of performing inferences. Rather, they are much closer to the Process Rules of Qualitative Process Theory. That is:

* The antecedent (IF) clauses are there to match up on Task descriptions in the Agenda.
* The consequent (THEN) clauses can have side effects in the entire system such as modifying concepts or relations, creating or destroying concepts, posing new tasks, and even logging a trace of what they are doing.
